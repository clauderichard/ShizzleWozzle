# ShizzleWozzle
A video game where you must balance a reversed pendulum.

# How to play
The file shizzlewozzle.html is a self-contained file having the Javascript version of the game. Simply open it in a web browser like Firefox to play it.
The physics model is a reversed pendulum, where the base is free to move left and right.
Use the arrow keys (right and left) to control the bottom part of the pendulum (apply a force to the left or right). The object of the game is to balance the reversed pendulum such that the top part doesn't fall and also doesn't hit the walls. As soon as you lose the game resets so you can try again.

# The other game
The file game.html is a self-contained file that has another Javascript game where you swing a ball around with your mouse. Open this file in a web browser, then you can grab the white ball with your mouse and swing it around. The physics are based on there being a spring between the mouse and the ball when you start dragging it, but the spring disappears when you release the mouse button.

# The defunct C++ version of ShizzleWozzle
There are 2 versions of this game, and one of them (the C++ version) unfortunately doesn't work and would have to be rewritten, since it depends on some old code of mine that I misplaced.
